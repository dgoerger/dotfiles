dotfiles
========

These dotfiles are updated for current Fedora versions (see `postinstall.sh`). Certain configs and paths may not be applicable to other distros or OSes. Mostly they are, but no guarantees.

Why is this a repo of manual file copies?
-----------------------------------------

- goal: bootstrap a machine, don't configuration-manage it

- multi-machine: not all files are applied everywhere (see other branches)

- security: some files should have root ownership and restricted write
