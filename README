dotfiles
========

May these be useful.


Compatibility
-------------

Unless otherwise noted, these confs and scripts should work correctly
on OpenBSD-current, with versions tagged corresponding with each
release.

Dotfiles, as well as a subset of sysconfs and bin scripts, are also
regularly battle-tested against Alpine- and Debian-stable.

macOS is tested infrequently, and dotfiles-only.
