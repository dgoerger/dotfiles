# privoxy-3.0.26: /etc/privoxy/config
#
#  2.5. actionsfile
#  =================
#
#  Specifies:
#
#      The actions file(s) to use
#
#  Type of value:
#
#      Complete file name, relative to confdir
#
actionsfile /etc/privoxy/dnsblock.action
#
#  4.1. listen-address
#  ====================
#
#  Specifies:
#
#      The address and TCP port on which Privoxy will listen for
#      client requests.
#
#  Type of value:
#
#      [IP-Address]:Port
#
#      [Hostname]:Port
#
Listen-address  127.0.0.1:1080
#
#  4.3. enable-remote-toggle
#  ==========================
#
#  Specifies:
#
#      Whether or not the web-based toggle feature may be used
#
enable-remote-toggle  0
#
#  4.4. enable-remote-http-toggle
#  ===============================
#
#  Specifies:
#
#      Whether or not Privoxy recognizes special HTTP headers to
#      change its behaviour.
#
enable-remote-http-toggle  0
#
#  4.5. enable-edit-actions
#  =========================
#
#  Specifies:
#
#      Whether or not the web-based actions file editor may be used
#
enable-edit-actions 0
#
#  4.6. enforce-blocks
#  ====================
#
#  Specifies:
#
#      Whether the user is allowed to ignore blocks and can "go there
#      anyway".
#
enforce-blocks 1
#
#  5.2. forward-socks4, forward-socks4a, forward-socks5 and forward-socks5t
#  =========================================================================
#
#  Specifies:
#
#      Through which SOCKS proxy (and optionally to which parent HTTP
#      proxy) specific requests should be routed.
#
#  Type of value:
#
#      target_pattern socks_proxy[:port] http_parent[:port]
#
#      where target_pattern is a URL pattern that specifies to which
#      requests (i.e. URLs) this forward rule shall apply. Use / to
#      denote "all URLs". http_parent and socks_proxy are IP
#      addresses in dotted decimal notation or valid DNS names (
#      http_parent may be "." to denote "no HTTP forwarding"), and
#      the optional port parameters are TCP ports, i.e. integer
#      values from 1 to 65535
#
#  Default value:
#
#      Unset
#
#  Effect if unset:
#
#      Don't use SOCKS proxies.
#
#  Notes:
#
#      Multiple lines are OK, they are checked in sequence, and the
#      last match wins.
#
#      The difference between forward-socks4 and forward-socks4a is
#      that in the SOCKS 4A protocol, the DNS resolution of the
#      target hostname happens on the SOCKS server, while in SOCKS 4
#      it happens locally.
#
#      With forward-socks5 the DNS resolution will happen on the
#      remote server as well.
#
#      forward-socks5t works like vanilla forward-socks5 but lets
#      Privoxy additionally use Tor-specific SOCKS extensions.
#      Currently the only supported SOCKS extension is optimistic
#      data which can reduce the latency for the first request made
#      on a newly created connection.
#
#      socks_proxy and http_parent can be a numerical IPv6 address
#      (if RFC 3493 is implemented). To prevent clashes with the port
#      delimiter, the whole IP address has to be put into brackets.
#      On the other hand a target_pattern containing an IPv6 address
#      has to be put into angle brackets (normal brackets are
#      reserved for regular expressions already).
#
#      If http_parent is ".", then requests are not forwarded to
#      another HTTP proxy but are made (HTTP-wise) directly to the
#      web servers, albeit through a SOCKS proxy.
#
forward-socks5t / 127.0.0.1:9050 .
#
#  6.8. socket-timeout
#  ====================
#
#  Specifies:
#
#      Number of seconds after which a socket times out if no data is
#      received.
#
#  Type of value:
#
#      Time in seconds.
#
socket-timeout 15
